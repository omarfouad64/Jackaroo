# Jackaroo - Single Player Edition

Jackaroo is a beloved strategic board/card game with deep roots in Middle Eastern culture, particularly in the Gulf region. Known for its unique blend of marbles, cards, and tactical gameplay, Jackaroo challenges players to think critically, plan strategically, and adapt to ever-changing scenarios. Its balance of skill, strategy, and luck makes it a favorite for both casual and competitive players.

## Our Unique Spin on Jackaroo

Traditionally, Jackaroo is a multiplayer game played by 2 to 8 players in teams of two. **However, for the scope of this project, Jackaroo will be reimagined as a single-player experience**, where the player is responsible for their own marbles and plays against 3 CPU players.

This is not just a recreation of the traditional game. As part of this project, we will design our own new version of Jackaroo, complete with custom rules and mechanics, to add a fresh twist to this classic. This adaptation will:

- Introduce new cards and rules that enhance gameplay and bring innovative challenges.
- Feature customized mechanics to make the game more dynamic and exciting, tailored for a single-player experience.

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against 3 CPU-controlled players.
- **New Cards & Rules**: Custom-designed cards and new rules for enhanced strategic depth.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Adaptable mechanics that keep the game exciting and challenging.
  
Enjoy the updated version of Jackaroo, designed for solo play with a fresh, innovative approach!
